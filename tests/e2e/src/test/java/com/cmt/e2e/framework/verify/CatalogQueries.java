/**
 * Canonical CUBRID catalog queries for {@link CatalogSnapshot}. Each
 * has an explicit {@code ORDER BY} for determinism, filters DBA/PUBLIC
 * owners and {@code flyway_%} (Flyway's history table is a seed-side
 * concern, not part of the migration contract). Map keys double as
 * snapshot file names ({@code snapshots/<scenario>/<key>.txt}).
 *
 * <p>Indexes are split by kind into separate snapshots — pk / fk /
 * unique (non-PK) / indexes (everything else) — so a diff immediately
 * tells you which category broke. Each per-kind query joins
 * {@code db_index_key} to keep key columns inline with index identity.
